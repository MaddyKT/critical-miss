# Scenario work log — 2026-01-26

Maddy request: add many more scenarios (BitLife-ish freshness) with branching story arcs.

## Notes
- Web search tool unavailable (missing Brave key). Using browser/manual sources when needed.
- I’m drafting scenarios as content files first; app integration can happen after.

## Deliverables (completed)
- Draft schema: `SCENARIO_SCHEMA.md`
- Initial scenario pack: `pack_v1.md`

## In progress / queued
- Background task: BitLife mechanics deep dive + scenario generation (completed)
- Background task: monetization research + recommendations (running)
